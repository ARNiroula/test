      Use our position utilities to place navbars in non-static positions.
      Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top
      (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed
      navbars use position: fixed, meaning theyâ€™re pulled from the normal flow
      of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., padding-top on the ""body>)
      to prevent overlap with other elements.
